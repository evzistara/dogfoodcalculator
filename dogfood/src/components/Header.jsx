          Not sure how much to feed your dog? This tool helps you calculate your
          dog's daily food needs based on their age, weight, and activity level.
          Whether you're feeding dry food, raw food, or a mix of both â€” we've
          got you covered. You'll also get a personalized feeding recommendation
          at the end!
